- Quick settings tile for switching the L2/R2 style with user selectable option for which styles to cycle through
- Single press home button setting to allow going to the home screen by a single press of the home button
- Display saturation setting. This is set immediately and will be applied after a reboot as well. Note that it takes a few seconds after you first unlock the device to apply.
